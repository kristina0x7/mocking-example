<table>
<tr>
<td>

Welcome to **Kitty Booking System**, Lab 2 at ITHS Java! 🐱🌌<br>
This project demonstrates **TDD, unit testing, and testable architecture** for booking and payment systems.<br>
We implement **mocking, dependency injection, and reliable design patterns**.<br><br>

## 🌟 About the Project

This project is a **space-themed environment** for practicing modern Java development principles.<br>
It includes modules for:
- 📦 **BookingSystem:** Book and cancel rooms with notifications
- 💳 **PaymentProcessor:** Testable payment handling
- 🛒 **ShoppingCart:** TDD-driven implementation with total price, discounts, and quantity updates

## 🌌 Space Cats Oversee the System

Our Booking System is **robust and reliable**, guided by the “space cats” overseeing proper flow and testing.  
All operations, from bookings to payments, are **carefully monitored** to ensure correctness and reliability.

> 🚀😸 **Limitless and scalable** – the system can handle bookings efficiently, inspired by the agility of cosmic cats.
